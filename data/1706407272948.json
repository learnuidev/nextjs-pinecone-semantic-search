To provide the populations for these counties, it is necessary to rely on approximations or specific data, as actual population figures can vary and may not be readily available for each county without access to updated demographic databases or government resources which are outside the scope of this platform. Furthermore, many of these locations fall within China's Yunnan Province and other areas, where population data can fluctuate due to various factors including urbanization, migration, and policy changes. 

Given these constraints and the broad list provided, generating fictional or estimated numbers would not offer accurate or reliable information. For current, precise population figures, I recommend consulting official government publications, local administrative offices, or statistical departments that provide demographic details for specific regions. Additionally, international databases like the World Bank or United Nations might offer some insights into regional populations, though they may not break down data to the county level.
